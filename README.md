# Goofy ahh website

Ever wanted a website that looks like it was made as a shitpost? Well here you go you brainrotted Family Guy fans.

# Prepare to be amazed!

This website uses Python- specifically FastAPI for the server/API handling. Render was used to deploy this on the goofy ahh web. Currently the link is https://random-family-guy-quote.onrender.com.

(BTW, this is a troll website. If you were expecting quality... I don't know what to tell you G...)

#Want to improve this website? Go right ahead! Fork this bad boy, push it real good, and Render should deploy it again you dirty boy.
